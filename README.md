# 🚀 YuminQuantool Backtest Framework

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to **YuminQuantool**, a sophisticated backtest framework meticulously crafted by Yumin. This framework is designed to empower quantitative researchers and developers with robust tools for conducting comprehensive backtests in the realms of Alpha and CTA strategies.

### 🔍 Alpha: Factor Investing

**Alpha** in the context of quantitative finance refers to the excess return on a portfolio that exceeds what would be predicted by models reflecting the portfolio's risk profile. Our framework supports the development and backtesting of factor-based investment strategies, enabling users to explore the efficacy of different factors in generating alpha.

### 📈 CTA: Commodity Trading Advisor

**CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor)** strategies are a cornerstone of systematic trading, focusing on directional bets on futures markets. YuminQuantool provides an event-driven framework for testing and refining CTA strategies, allowing users to simulate trading conditions and evaluate performance across different market scenarios.

### 🎊 EventDriven: Event-Driven Strategy (Stock)
**EventDriven** is now available! As a significant source of returns beyond factor strategies, this framework particularly shines when asynchronous signals such as mergers, dividends, and other events occur. It will showcase the average returns before and after events, the total strategy returns, and the frequency of event occurrences, providing you with a comprehensive investment analysis tool.

### 🚧 Operators supported by Cython/Numba

Operators like time-series, cross-section, logic, arithmetic, etc. are coming soon! Stay tuned for updates on this exciting feature.
